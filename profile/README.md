At **reXa**, we solve the common problem among many people that is less cared —  
typically meaning you daily get some sort of rewards,  
but how many of them are you guys using really — be honest.

At reXa, we found a common pattern:  
The rewards that I get may not be useful for me, but useful for you —  
so I can either exchange with what you have that is useful to me,  
or I can sell it, with which you can get more profit  
than without using that particular reward.

We are currently developing: **Android version**  

**Web version** — an initial version where you manually enter the reward details,  
  exchange them for some sort of **reX points**, with which you can buy other rewards.
